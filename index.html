        <p class="lead mb-4">As a graduate of the University of California, Riverside, I have built a strong foundation in leadership, collaboration, and strategic thinking, shaped by my academic experience and enriched through real-world application. My undergraduate studies at UCR provided me with essential knowledge, but more importantly, they taught me the value of stepping outside the classroom to gain practical experience. Throughout my academic career, I pursued roles that would challenge me, helping me develop as a team leader and collaborator in various settings. I understood early on that experience outside the classroom was just as critical to my growth as my academic studies.

These roles allowed me to engage in different aspects of team management and event coordination, giving me valuable insights into the logistics and nuances of working with others under pressure. One of my most fulfilling experiences involved coordinating live events and facilitating smooth operations for shows, where I was responsible for ensuring that all aspects ran seamlessly. This role gave me a new perspective on event coordination, one that emphasized the importance of collaboration and open communication. I learned that every individual’s contribution matters when stakes are high and deadlines are tight, and I prioritized creating an atmosphere where clear communication kept everyone informed and aligned. 
<br><br>

        Managing a team during these live events was a particularly rewarding challenge. I found great satisfaction in helping my team stay composed under pressure and ensuring that each task was completed efficiently. This role also taught me the importance of leading by example. I promised myself that I would remain calm under pressure, knowing that my attitude could set the tone for the entire team. I took great care to ensure that each team member felt valued and informed, fostering an environment where everyone could perform at their best, even in high-stress situations. I learned how to balance the needs of individual team members with the overarching goals of the team, developing my ability to empower others.

These early experiences helped me refine my problem-solving skills and shaped my ability to lead with empathy and resilience. I found that I had a gift for identifying the strengths and areas for growth in each team member, which allowed me to tackle tasks effectively and build a well-rounded, motivated team. Despite the added stress, I discovered that I thrive in high-energy environments and always aim to make a positive impact. 
<br><br>

        Looking forward, I am eager to carry these skills with me as I pursue a career in law. The work I have done to coordinate events to foster a strong team environment. This has shown me the importance of clear communication and composure.These qualities are valuable in the legal field, and I am committed to building on them as I advance further in my career. Ultimately, my goal is to own my law firm, where I can lead a team dedicated to serving clients with honesty, empathy, and a commitment to excellence. My experiences have equipped me to handle the challenges ahead, and I am driven to create a positive environment.
